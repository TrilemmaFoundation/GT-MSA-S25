    "Each team must submit a polished, well-documented notebook that communicates insights clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Submission Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "* Submit a **Python notebook** named `btc_accumulation_model.ipynb`\n",
    "* Save it in a folder called `deliverables` at the root of your GitHub repo\n",
    "* Title the notebook (first markdown cell) to reflect your strategy\n",
    "  *Example: `Optimal Bitcoin Accumulation via a 200-day MA Model`*\n",

    "* Summarize your **modeling approach**\n",
    "* Highlight key **EDA insights** that led to your strategy\n",
    "* Discuss the strengths and limitations of your model referencing its `Final Model Score`. \n",
    "* Keep it concise and understandable without technical depth\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis Highlights\n",

    "#### 🛠️ Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clone the template notebook\n",
    "2. Define your features inside `construct_features()` under `✍️ User Code`\n",
    "3. Write your model logic inside `compute_weights()` under `✍️ User Code`\n",
    "4. Run all cells top-to-bottom\n",
    "5. You must see: ```✅ Strategy is ready for submission.```\n",

    "* Outputs weights that:\n",

    "  * Are all **positive**\n",
    "  * Are all **≥ MIN\\_WEIGHT**\n",
    "  * **Sum to 1** in each window\n",

    "\n",
    "We’ve moved away from full automation to give you **more modeling freedom**. You may modify:\n",

    "* **`load_data()`**:\n",
    "  If using external `.csv` files, link a separate notebook showing how they were created (don't include API keys).\n",

    "* **Imports**:\n",
    "  Add additional imports under this section in the `✍️ User Code` cell:\n",

    "\n",
    "* 🧠 Your notebook should have a **30-second takeaway**: readers should grasp the core idea with a quick skim\n",
    "* 🔬 It should also support **deep dives**: link full EDA and model development notebooks for those who want details\n",
    "* ✨ Make it **visually clean** and polished—use headings, markdown, and readable plotsx"

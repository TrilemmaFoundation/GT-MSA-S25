# Improving Bitcoin Accumulation Strategies  
Georgia Tech MSA Summer 2025 Practicum

Welcome to the official practicum repository. This project challenges students to go beyond Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) and build data-driven models for optimizing Bitcoin accumulation.

---

## üîç Why: Problem Statement

The world‚Äôs most influential entities‚Äîincluding asset managers, financial institutions, and sovereign wealth funds‚Äîare actively accumulating Bitcoin or investigating strategies to do so. This nascent accumulation race underscores a fundamental game-theoretic principle: as others acquire a mathematically scarce asset, the incentive to participate intensifies.

While Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) remains a widely utilized approach, it may prove suboptimal amid such competitive dynamics. This project seeks to design data-driven accumulation strategies that retain the key advantages of DCA‚Äînamely, consistent and systematic purchases‚Äîwhile enhancing the efficiency of Bitcoin acquisition within a specified budget and time frame. The resulting insights are applicable to retail investors but are particularly valuable for institutions managing high-volume allocations.

## üì¶ What: Project Deliverables

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (Deadline: **June 12**)
- **Purpose**: Identify and evaluate features for smart accumulation strategies.
- **Goal**: Visualize data and extract **non-trivial insights** that could inform model design.
- **Deliverable**: A Jupyter notebook showcasing your EDA with compelling visualizations and commentary.

### 2. Model Code
- **Purpose**: Create a strategy that leverages the provided data to outperform DCA on a backtest. 
- **Goal**: Beat the **200-Day Moving Average (200D MA)** baseline in terms of average SPD. 
- **Deliverable**: A modular and reproducible model notebook or script.

### 3. Educational Notebook (Deadline: **July 10**)
- **Purpose**: Explain your strategy to a non-technical audience.
- **Goal**: Visualize and narrate your strategy's logic and results as if teaching a curious layperson.
- **Deliverable**: A polished notebook with plots and explanations.

## üöÄ How: Project Culture

### Work in Public, Commit in Private
- While this is an **open-source practicum**, we ask each team to push their weekly progress to the **private repository** provided (e.g., `GT-MSA-S25-{team-name}`).
- These repos are private during the challenge and will be made **public** after the model deadline passes.
- If nothing is being pushed, we assume no work is being done.

### Show Initiative
- **Ask questions** in Discord or during weekly office hours.
- We‚Äôre here to help‚Äîbut your **progress determines how much we can support**.
- Share what you're learning, even if it's messy‚Äî**insight comes from iteration**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

1. **Send us your GitHub username** so we can invite you to a GitHub Team with access to your private repo (`GT-MSA-S25-{team name}`).
2. Read Chapter 1 & 2 of [Mastering Bitcoin](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook)
3. **Review the [Problem Statement notebook](https://github.com/TrilemmaFoundation/GT-MSA-S25/blob/main/1.%20Problem%20Statement.ipynb)** to understand the exact objectives of the challenge.
4. **Use the [Data Retrieval notebook](https://github.com/TrilemmaFoundation/GT-MSA-S25/blob/main/2.%20Data%20Retrieval.ipynb)** to fetch and begin exploring the dataset.
5. **Review the [Model Development notebook](https://github.com/TrilemmaFoundation/GT-MSA-S25/blob/main/3.%20Model%20Development%20Template.ipynb)** to use as a reference for structuring and benchmarking your own model.
6. **Check this repository regularly** as we will be updating it with new tutorials, resources, and guidance.

## üì£ Final Notes

- Submit all deliverables as Jupyter Notebooks unless otherwise specified.
- All work will be evaluated not only on technical correctness but also **storytelling, clarity, and educational value**.
- The best strategies may be highlighted publicly, so polish your work accordingly.

Let‚Äôs build something exceptional üöÄ

    "\n",
    "We want to generalize Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) to maximize Bitcoin accumulation by allowing **dynamic daily purchases**, while still preserving DCA‚Äôs core benefit: **regular, systematic purchases**.\n",

    "\n",
    "Build a **feature-driven model** (in Python) that maps historical Bitcoin data (see [get_data.ipynb](https://github.com/TrilemmaFoundation/GT-S25-MSA/blob/main/get_data.ipynb)) to daily purchase proportions (weights).  \n",
